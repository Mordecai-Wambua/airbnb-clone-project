# airbnb-clone-project
A Booking Management System. 

## Project overview
This is a comprehensive, real-world application designed to simulate the development of a robust booking platform like Airbnb. It involves a deep dive into full-stack development, focusing on backend systems, database design, API development, and application security. This project enables one to understand complex architectures, workflows, and collaborative team dynamics while building a scalable web application.

## Project goals
- Master collaborative team workflows using GitHub.
- Deepen their understanding of backend architecture and database design principles.
- Implement advanced security measures for API development.
- Gain proficiency in designing and managing CI/CD pipelines for efficient deployment.
- Strengthen their ability to document and plan complex software projects effectively.
- Develop an understanding of integrating technologies like Django, MySQL, and GraphQL in a unified ecosystem

## Tech stack.
- Django
- MySQL
- Docker
- GitHub Actions

## Team Roles
### Backend Developer
- Developing APIs that handle requests from the front end and return the correct data or actions.
- Writing server-side code.
- Connecting to databases (SQL or NoSQL), managing data flow, and performing CRUD operations.
- Implementing authentication and authorization, ensuring users can securely access the parts of the app they’re allowed to.
- Optimizing application performance, handling load balancing, and managing background jobs or scheduled tasks.
- Collaborating with front-end developers and DBAs to align logic, design, and data integrity.

### Database Administrato
- Designing the database structure to align with the project’s needs, including tables, relationships, and indexing strategies.
- Managing data access, ensuring developers and apps can query and update data safely and quickly.
- Implementing security controls, such as user roles and permissions, to protect sensitive information.
- Optimizing performance by tuning queries, indexing, and monitoring database load to prevent slowdowns.

## Technology Stack

- **Django:** A high-level Python web framework used to build robust backend systems and RESTful APIs.
- **MySQL:** A relational database used to store application data such as users, properties, bookings, and reviews.
- **GraphQL:** A query language used for APIs to allow clients to request exactly the data they need.
- **Docker:** Used to containerize the application and ensure consistent development and deployment environments.
- **GitHub Actions:** Enables CI/CD by automating testing and deployment workflows.

## Database Design
#### Entities and Relationships

- **Users**
  - `id`, `name`, `email`, `password`, `role`
  - A user can book multiple properties and post reviews.

- **Properties**
  - `id`, `owner_id`, `location`, `price`, `description`
  - A property is listed by a user and can have multiple bookings.

- **Bookings**
  - `id`, `user_id`, `property_id`, `check_in`, `check_out`
  - A booking belongs to one user and one property.

- **Reviews**
  - `id`, `user_id`, `property_id`, `rating`, `comment`
  - A user can post multiple reviews for properties they've booked.

- **Payments**
  - `id`, `booking_id`, `amount`, `payment_method`, `status`
  - Each payment is linked to a specific booking.
 
## Feature Breakdown
- **User Management:** Enables user registration, login, role assignment, and secure session management.
- **Property Management:** Allows property owners to list, update, and delete their rental properties.
- **Booking System:** Users can book available properties by selecting dates and making payments.
- **Review System:** After a booking, users can leave feedback to help others make informed choices.
- **Payment Gateway Integration:** Supports secure transactions and payment tracking.
- **Admin Panel:** Admin users can monitor system activity, manage users, and flag/report suspicious listings.

## API Security
#### Security Measures

- **Authentication:** Ensures only registered users can access protected endpoints.
- **Authorization:** Grants different access levels to users based on roles (e.g., admin vs. regular user).
- **Rate Limiting:** Prevents abuse by limiting the number of requests a user can make in a certain time.
- **Input Validation:** Protects against injection attacks by sanitizing input.
- **HTTPS:** Ensures secure communication over the network.

**Why Security Matters:**
- Protects user data and personal information.
- Secures financial transactions.
- Builds trust with end users.
- Prevents unauthorized access and data breaches.

## CI/CD Pipeline
CI/CD (Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment) pipelines automate the testing and deployment of code changes. This leads to faster, more reliable releases and easier collaboration among team members.

**Tools Used:**
- **GitHub Actions:** Automates testing, linting, and deployments.
- **Docker:** Creates consistent environments for building and deploying applications.
- **Heroku/DigitalOcean (optional):** Hosting platforms for deploying containerized applications.
